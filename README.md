# My Next.js Template

Welcome to My Next.js Template! This project is a boilerplate for building web applications using Next.js, Prisma, PostgreSQL, and NextAuth for authentication. It provides a solid foundation for developing scalable and maintainable applications.

## Features

- **Next.js**: A powerful React framework for building server-rendered applications.
- **Prisma**: An ORM for Node.js and TypeScript that simplifies database access.
- **PostgreSQL**: A robust relational database system.
- **NextAuth**: A complete open-source authentication solution for Next.js applications.

   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:

   ```

5. **Open your browser**:
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see your application in action.

## Development

You can start editing the main page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page will auto-update as you make changes.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a modern font family for Vercel.
